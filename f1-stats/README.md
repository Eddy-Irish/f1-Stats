# Formula One Statistics

This website contains current & historical data about Formula One Drivers, Constructors, & Seasons. 

I love Formula One, and have been watching obsessively since the beginning of the 2014 season, and while I love
to peruse the Wikipedia pages of various historical seasons, I thought I could create some interesting new ways
to visualize and view the data, along with a few datapoints that most F1 data sites don't have.

I'm also always looking to code independent projects as a way to learn new languages, frameworks and/or stacks.
I've been learning and practicing React for a while now, really like it, and want to get more and more comfortable 
using it.  So, the site will be built with 
### React
AND
### Rechart
  --> for the graphs and data visualizations






## Features

There either currently is, or are currently plans for data & graphs for the following...

### 2021 F1 Season 

### Historical F1 Seasons

### Individual Drivers

### Individual Constructors

### All-Time F1 Records
